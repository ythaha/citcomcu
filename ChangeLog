	* src/Output_gzdir.c, src/prototypes.h: Declar safe_gzopen() as
	  static so that it won't appear in prototypes.h. This would avoid
	  depending on zlib.h when compiling the code. The code will still
	  depend on zlib, but nowaday every unix system has zlib installed
	  by default.
	  
	  PS: one should avoid hand-editing prototypes.h. This file can be
	  regenerated by running: $ cproto -p > a && mv a prototypes.h

2009-11-19 19:56  tan2

	* src/Viscosity_structures.c: There is no function_defs.h. All
	  prototypes should be put in prototypes.h

2009-11-19 19:55  tan2

	* src/Parsing.c: In ANSI C, we only need to include string.h for
	  strlen, strcpy, strstr, and strcat.

2009-11-19 19:36  tan2

	* src/Viscosity_structures.c, src/prototypes.h: Declare these
	  private functions as static

2009-09-04 23:32  becker

	* src/Convection.c, src/Ggrd_handling.c, src/Output_gzdir.c:
	  Implemented rudimentary restart facility for gzdir output,
	  several local mods still not in CIG version of CitcomCU.

2009-08-25 17:22  becker

	* src/Citcom.c, src/Instructions.c, src/Viscosity_structures.c,
	  src/global_defs.h, src/viscosity_descriptions.h: Added
	  T_interior_max control Tentaive implementation of steady-state
	  strain-rate weakening

2009-03-27 01:11  becker

	* src/Advection_diffusion.c, src/Makefile,
	  src/Viscosity_structures.c: Fixed typo in Viscosity_structures.c
	  (omission of break for option 4)

2008-11-07 03:29  becker

	* src/Advection_diffusion.c, src/Construct_arrays.c,
	  src/Convection.c, src/Convection_variables.h,
	  src/Drive_solvers.c, src/Ggrd_handling.c, src/Instructions.c,
	  src/Makefile, src/Makefile.gzdir, src/Nodal_mesh.c,
	  src/Output_gzdir.c, src/Pan_problem_misc_functions.c,
	  src/Parsing.c, src/Process_velocity.c, src/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c,
	  src/Viscosity_structures.c, src/global_defs.h, src/prototypes.h,
	  src/viscosity_descriptions.h: Replaced Parsing.c with the CIG
	  CitcomS version to ensure that defaults settings are actually
	  used. Before, the respective function always returned NULL to
	  avoid problems with strtok on Linux.
	  
	  Modified layers() such that the full range of 1...4 layers gets
	  assigned to E->mat[], otherwise not all four layers would be used
	  in Viscosity_structures.c
	  
	  Added two new temp dep rheology options, rheol==3 is very similar
	  to 0, and case has a non-dim depth dependence in it
	  
	  Added ggrd netcdf support for temperature and composition using
	  the HC package.
	  
	  Added gzdir output, in which case (-DUSE_GZDIR),
	  get_system_viscosity will compute the visocosities at the nodes.

2008-05-02 23:57  tan2

	* src/Drive_solvers.c: Changed the type of a variable from float to
	  double. This will avoid type-conversion later in the loop.

2008-05-02 23:56  tan2

	* src/Advection_diffusion.c, src/Citcom.c,
	  src/Viscosity_structures.c: nit'd variables at beginning

2008-05-02 23:56  tan2

	* src/Construct_arrays.c, src/Element_calculations.c,
	  src/General_matrix_functions.c, src/Instructions.c,
	  src/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c: Fixed some memory problems in the
	  Stokes solver.
	  
	  Some arrays were not allcated with enough elements (off by 1).
	  Writing to the end of those arrays can potentially overwrite
	  other parts of the memory. In practice, it seems that this bug
	  didn't affect the solver at all, but this is a subtle bug to
	  detect.
	  
	  This bug was in CitcomS pre-1.0 version and is likely in other
	  versions of citcom family as well.

2008-05-02 23:43  tan2

	* src/Convection.c: Disable unused input parameters

	  function prototypes.

2005-12-16 03:02  luis

	* src/prototypes.h: Somehow, cproto promotes float to double and
	  char to int by default.
	  Disabled such promotion with -p flag, and regenerated
	  prototypes.h
	  with the correct function prototypes.

2005-12-15 23:01  luis

	* src/Advection_diffusion.c, src/Instructions.c, src/global_defs.h,
	  src/prototypes.h: Added function prototypes to new file
	  prototypes.h, and modified
	  global_defs.h to include it. Two bugs were exposed by this.
	  First, eliminated an extraneous argument to the function calls
	  to temperatures_conform_bcs() in the Advection_diffusion.c
	  source.
	  Second, changed the signature of the signal handler in
	  Instructions.c
	  from (void)(interuption(void)) to (void)(interruption(int)).

	  function gen_determinant().

2005-12-15 03:03  luis

	  should be an array
	  of type higher_precision, not type double.

2005-12-15 03:00  luis

	* src/Drive_solvers.c: In general_stokes_solver(), the variable
